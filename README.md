#Simple Logger with TDD

These are just the files I created while following along the Tuts+ course [Test-Driven PHP in Action](https://tutsplus.com/course/test-driven-php/)

Before running the tests or testing the index file you have to install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and run it on the root directory to create the autoloader.
